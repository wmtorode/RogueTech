Intended for deployment with Protectorate Militia units and Free Worlds League formations, the Blakists sought to rebuild the design with newer technology and correct some of the flaws apparent in the older design. Installing a new Light Fusion Engine and Endo Steel enabled the designers to swap the Thumper for the much larger and more powerful Sniper Artillery Canon. Defensively the design mounts CASE to protect against the ammunition explosions that plagued the older 4E model. A swap to ER Lasers and DHS round out the design, giving it increased range and striking power. Popular with Hunchback pilots and Artillery units, the design is slated for continuous production; with Kali Yama having to expand their Hunchback line to keep up with demand.",
